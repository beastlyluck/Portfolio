# Hi there, I’m Atharva 👋

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate and current Master of Data Science student at Monash University, based in Melbourne, Australia. I combine my passion for **data science**, **artificial intelligence**, and **game development** to build impactful projects—from predictive models and interactive dashboards to mythological game concepts rendered in anime-inspired art.
